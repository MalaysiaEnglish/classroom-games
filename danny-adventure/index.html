      <p>It is not the usual smell of engine oil and petrol and dad's terrible instant coffee. It is something quite different. Something that smells remarkably like... <strong>cake</strong>.</p>

      <p><span class="dad-speech">"Ah,"</span> he says. <span class="dad-speech">"Danny, my boy. You weren't supposed to see that."</span></p>
      <p>Inside the box are forty-seven perfectly iced cupcakes.</p>
      <p>They have tiny sugar flowers on top. Some of them have little bees made of marzipan. Your father, who once rebuilt a tractor engine using only a paperclip and a piece of wire, has apparently also been making <strong>marzipan bees</strong>.</p>

      <p>Up close, the chocolate tower is even taller than it looked. It is also, you notice, trembling slightly. Seven tiers of Belgian chocolate, stacked improbably high, held together by what appears to be an unreasonable amount of hope and not much else.</p>
      <p><span class="hazell-speech">"Can I help you?"</span> says Hazell, appearing at your elbow like an angry weather front.</p>
      <p><span class="dialogue">"Just admiring it,"</span> you say. <span class="dialogue">"It's very tall."</span></p>
      <p><span class="hazell-speech">"Seven tiers. Belgian chocolate. Imported."</span></p>
      <p><span class="dialogue">"Does it lean slightly to the left?"</span></p>
      <p>Hazell looks at the tower. It does, undeniably, lean to the left. His face suggests this is not information he wanted.</p>
      <p>At this moment, Mr Pringle the vicar drifts past with a very full plate, bumps the table gently, and the tower leans a little further. Everyone in the vicinity takes a small step back.</p>

      <p>The tower falls in slow motion.</p>
      <p>It is, in its way, magnificent. Seven tiers of Belgian chocolate, rotating gracefully as they descend, landing across the judging table with a sound like a very expensive mistake.</p>
      <p>Tier five lands on Mrs Clipstone's clipboard. Tier three lands directly on Mr Pringle's trifle, which he was clearly planning to return to. Tier one — the largest — slides off the edge entirely and comes to rest against Hazell's left Wellington boot.</p>
      <p>There is a very long silence.</p>
      <p><span class="hazell-speech">"It was the table,"</span> says Hazell. <span class="hazell-speech">"The table is uneven."</span></p>
      <p>Mrs Clipstone removes a piece of chocolate from her clipboard. She writes something down with great firmness in red pen.</p>
      <span class="aside">You look across the hall. Dad's cupcakes stand serenely on their white stand, twelve small perfect things that have not moved an inch.</span>

      <p><span class="dialogue">"First prize,"</span> says Mrs Clipstone, and the room is very quiet, <span class="dialogue">"goes to Doris Plumsworth."</span></p>
      <p>The room applauds.</p>
      <p>Dad does not move. Then, very slowly, he smiles. It is not a large smile. It is a quiet, private, deeply pleased smile — the smile of a man who has baked forty-seven cupcakes in a garage and stood in a field humming to bees and kept a brilliant secret for three years, and who has finally, absolutely, unmistakably won.</p>
      <p><span class="dialogue">"That's you,"</span> you whisper.</p>
      <p><span class="dad-speech">"Yes,"</span> says Dad. <span class="dad-speech">"I suppose it is."</span></p>
      <p>He goes up to collect the rosette. Mrs Clipstone hands him the prize envelope. She does not ask why Doris Plumsworth is wearing oil-stained overalls. This is one of her many excellent qualities.</p>
      <span class="aside">On the way home, Dad gives you the rosette. He says you've earned it more than Doris has. You wear it on your jacket all the way back to the filling station, and you feel, for no particular reason, that you are the luckiest boy in the world.</span>

      <p>That evening you sit outside the caravan on the wooden step, with mugs of hot chocolate and the rosette between you. The stars are out. Somewhere across the fields, a tawny owl is asking a question nobody answers.</p>
      <p><span class="dialogue">"Dad,"</span> you say. <span class="dialogue">"Is Doris Plumsworth going to retire now?"</span></p>
      <p>Dad thinks about this for a long time.</p>
      <p><span class="dad-speech">"I don't think so,"</span> he says at last. <span class="dad-speech">"She's already planning a lemon drizzle for next year."</span></p>
      <p>Inside the prize envelope, by the way, is a voucher for twelve pounds at the village garden centre, which Dad declares to be <em>"an absolute fortune"</em> and which you both know he will spend entirely on more baking equipment, hidden at the back of the workshop where nobody will see it.</p>
      <p>You lean against his shoulder, and the night is warm and still, and the filling station makes its small comfortable sounds — the creak of the pump, the tick of cooling metal — and everything is exactly as it should be.</p>
      <p>Your father, you think, is not like other fathers. Other fathers do not have secret baking identities. Other fathers do not hum to bees at four in the morning. Other fathers do not have the ability to make you feel, without ever quite saying so, that the world is full of extraordinary things waiting to be discovered.</p>
      <p>You are very glad he is yours.</p>
